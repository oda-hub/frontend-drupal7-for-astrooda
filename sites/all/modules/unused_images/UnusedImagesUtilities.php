   * In Drupal, many ways exist to reference an image in text fields. Note: in

   * base_url/sites/default/files/, the real folder will be resolved run-time.
   *
   * Variants:
   * - Used in different attributes of different tags:
   *   - <img src="/sites/default/files/img_7893.jpg?itok=Ul4ohBEJ">
   *   - <picture><source srcset="https://lescamelias.eu/sites/default/files/styles/flexslider_medium/public/puy-de-come.jpg?itok=W9Ez8ADL 1x, http://localhost/les-camelias/sites/default/files/styles/flexslider_full/public/puy-de-come.jpg?itok=ruByVCL3 2x" media="(min-width:660px)">
   *   - <a href="/sites/default/files/img_7893.jpg?itok=Ul4ohBEJ">
   *   - <li data-thumb="https://lescamelias.eu/sites/default/files/styles/flexslider_small/public/le-mont-dore-winter.jpg?itok=8-x1wdlc">
   * - Located in a sub folder of public://:
   *   - src="/sites/default/files/2018-12/user-3/img_7893.jpg?itok=Ul4ohBEJ"
   * - Used relative to the base path (instead of server root relative) (can
   *   lead to problems on multilingual sites with language prefix: always
   *   handed over to Drupal, never served directly):
   *   - src="sites/default/files/img_7893.jpg?itok=Ul4ohBEJ"
   * - Used relative to "current" page:
   *   - src="../sites/default/files/img_7893.jpg?itok=Ul4ohBEJ"
   * - Used as image derivative (image style):
   *   - src="/sites/default/files/styles/thumbnail/public/img_7893.jpg?itok=Ul4ohBEJ"
   * - Used without itok (when disabled):
   *   - src="/sites/default/files/styles/thumbnail/public/img_7893.jpg"
   * - Local/test/stage versions, work when Pathologic has been installed:
   *   - src="/les-camelias/sites/default/files/img_7893.jpg?itok=Ul4ohBEJ"
   * - Full domain and protocol references, also for local, test, stage. Work
   *   with Pathologic (or fail for localhost references for non-developers):
   *   - src="//localhost/les-camelias/sites/default/files/img_7893.jpg?itok=3Wo1lxT5"
   *   - src="http://localhost/les-camelias/sites/default/files/img_7893.jpg?itok=3Wo1lxT5"

   *   - src="https://lescamelias.eu/sites/default/files/img_7893.jpg?itok=3Wo1lxT5"
   * - Used on private or temporary:
   *   - src="/system/files/img_7893.jpg?itok=Ul4ohBEJ"
   *   - src="/system/temporary/img_7893.jpg?itok=Ul4ohBEJ"
   * - Attributes may be placed within single quotes:
   *   - src='/sites/default/files/img_7893.jpg?itok=Ul4ohBEJ'
   * - Other query parameters. If this is not an image but a document, no itok
   *   parameter will be present, but others may be, e.g a "version number" to
   *   bypass caching or a parameter for some download statistic.
   *
   * "Variants" not taken into account:
   * - Used in filter tags:
   *   - Media tags are based on fid (managed file), so do not contain image
   *     paths and are already taken care of via the Managed Files usage finder.
   *   - No known tags that use file names directly like e.g. [pubic://...]. If
   *     we learn of tags that do something like this, we might change the code
   *     to incorporate it.
   * - Plain text URLs that are converted to links using the 'Convert URLs into
   *   links' filter as this filter will not change a URL into an <img> tag, so
   *   this feature is not likely to be used with images. NOTE: this may
   *   actually be one of the few if not the only place where we really assume
   *   to be looking for images, not documents in general, so we might
   *   reconsider this.
   * - Attributes may be specified without quotes (i.e, I guess, if they do not
   *   contain spaces, > and other special characters):
   *   - src=/sites/default/files/img_7893.jpg?itok=Ul4ohBEJ
   *
   *  Regular expression:
   *  - ="(([^"?]+\.(jpg|jpeg|png|gif|))(\?[^"])?)"
   *  - ='(([^'?]+\.(jpg|jpeg|png|gif|))(\?[^'])?)'
   *    - match 0 = full quoted attribute value + quotes + =-sign: ignore.
   *    - match 1 = full uri with query: parse_url() and custom code will be
   *      used to see if it matches one of the above variants.
   *    - match 2 = uri without query: ignore.
   *    - match 3 = extension: ignore.
   *    - match 4 = optional query (including ?): ignore.

  /**
   * Returns regular expressions to use when searching for image uris that are
   * embedded in text.
   *
   * How to recognize references to images:
   * We cannot use the same restriction as in text fields, namely that an image
   * should appear as an attribute value and thus appears between quotes. We
   * also cannot use the method the url filter uses, see _filter_url(), as that
   * assumes that urls are absolute and thus start with a protocol or the domain
   * name.
   *
   * So we have do it differently:
   * - Find all occurrences of
   *   * A set of accepted characters, we base this set on the rules about uris
   *     and file names on local file systems, further restricted by disallowing
   *     common punctuation that may be expected to be a delimiter, not part of
   *     the image name, especially in texts with plain URL's that are
   *     transformed into links by a filter.
   *   * Ending with a dot followed by one of the selected extensions.
   *   * @TODO: Not followed by another extension.
   *
   * Note: https://perishablepress.com/stop-using-unsafe-characters-in-urls/ was
   * used to get the initial list of acceptable characters. But contrary to its
   * advice, it is common usage to allow unicode characters outside the ascii
   * range as browsers will encode them when sending them over the http
   * protocol. So I compiled a list of non-acceptable characters instead of
   * acceptable characters. Of course unsafe/reserved characters with a special
   * meaning (e.g. ':' and '/') are to be allowed as well. Whereas the safe
   * character "'" is often used as delimiter, so will not be accepted.
